A sharp collection of tools for web development created with performance in mind.  🔪🔪

Small bundle size and maximum FPS are our primary concerns 🤓.

That's why you can import every bit separately and tree-shake it, so you'll bring the minimum set of code you really need.

Aiming to achieve affidablity and affordability, we keep our tools sharp achieving 100% Coverage and A maintainability.

If you're into buzzwords then Okiba is: **dependency-free**, altough **internally cross-dependent**, built as a **lerna monorepo**.
