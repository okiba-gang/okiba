üèÖ

Sharp collection of tools for front-end development, created with performance in mind.  üó°

Our primary concerns are: **maximum FPS** and **minimum bundle size** üöÄ

You can visualize it as a bag full of **ninja tools** for you to pick and use to tackle your **front-end challenges**.

______


### Okiba **is**:

##### A set of tools you can use separately.

It is meant to **level-up** and **ease-in** your web-development routines.

It's designed so that you can drop-in as much or as less you want, by importing just what you actually use, up to a single function level, so that your final bundle will stay slim.

It is always evolving and open to contributons from OSS peers.

#### Okiba **is not**:

###### A library, framework or language.

It is not meant to replace the tools you already have, but rather offer battle-tested solutions to common routine tasks; sometimes it offers a cheaper alternative.

It does not impose choiches and integrates smoothly with frameworks you already use.

______

We strive to achieve **affidability** and **affordability**.

#### Our granularity is *fine*

###### We `export` single units that you can `import` separately. ‚ú®

This way **tree-shake** and **uglification** can work at their best.

Being **dependency-free** you always know what you're using and can look it up in our API, no surpises. üéÅ


#### Our code is *DRY* and *minimal*

###### If something is common we abstract it away. üí°

We don't put something in until it is actually needed.

We strictly check for duplication and complexity, and take charge of some development pain in order to keep bundle size small.

#### Our seriousness level is *high*

###### Our quality checks are automated. ü§ñ

Metrics matter, so our CI tools help us by enforcing **100% coverage** and **A maintainability**.

No line makes it into `master` if the overall code quality gets degraded.

_We could state that our API is 100% documented, but we still have no tests in place to back this metric up... so we don't ü§°_
