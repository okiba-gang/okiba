Sharp collection of tools for web development, created with performance in mind.  ðŸ”ªðŸ”ª

Our primary concerns are: **maximum FPS** and **minimum bundle size** ðŸ¤“

That's why you can import every bit separately, so you'll bring the minimum set of what you really need into your bundle.

Aiming to achieve affidability and affordability, we try our best to keep our tools sharp with 100% test coverage and A maintainability.

If you're into buzzwords then Okiba is:
> **tree-shake friendly**, **DRY**, **dependency-free**, altough **internally cross-dependent**, built as a **lerna monorepo**
